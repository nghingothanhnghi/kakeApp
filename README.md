This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Beside i've also installed some plugins develop the frontend regularly as

# Standard Plugin 
- React Router [Tutorial for install](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
- Axios. Call API [Tutorial for install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios#example)
- Tailwind CSS. [Tutorial for install here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite). You need some reference class from Tailwind, can get this [link](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet)
- Icon Set of [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).


# Start
In the project root directory, you can run:
<pre>npm install</pre>
<pre>npm run dev</pre>

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |


Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
